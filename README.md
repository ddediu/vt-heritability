# Code, data and results acompanying the paper "The heritability of vocal tract structures estimated from structural MRI in a large cohort of Dutch twins"

This repository contains the data, code and full results supporting the paper 
Dediu, D., Jennings, E.M., van â€™t Ent, D., Moisik, S.R., Di Pisa, G., Schulze, J., de Geus, E.J.C., den Braber, A., Dolan, C.V. & Boomsma, D.I. (2022) *The heritability of vocal tract structures estimated from structural MRI in a large cohort of Dutch twins*.

The repository is structured as follows:

- the file `vt-heritability.Rproj` is the `RStudio` project
- `data` contains the data, structured as follows:

  - `input` contains the input data ("raw") data, as follows:
  
    - `ReadMe.txt`: a readme document
    - `landmarks.csv`: a comma-separated CSV file contaning the description of the landmarks used to define the phenotypic measures
    - `measures-STUB.csv`: is an empty stub that keeps the structure of the missing "true" comma-separated CSV file `measures.csv` which, unfortunately, cannot be made public as it contains potentially identifiable information about our participants; without the "real" file the analysis cannot be run, but this file can be requested from the [Netherlands Twin Register](https://tweelingenregister.vu.nl/information_for_researchers/working-with-ntr-data)
    - `phenotype_names_decriptions.csv`: a comma-separated CSV file contaning the full name, short name, domain, type, and description of the phenotypic measures

  - `intermediate` contains various intermediate files, as follows:
  
    - `data_for_SEM-STUB.csv`: is an empty stub that keeps the structure of the missing "true" comma-separated CSV file `data_for_SEM.csv` which is dervied from the missing `measures.csv` and which contains potentially identifiable information about our participants; is automatically generated from `measures.csv` (when available) running the pre-processing scripts (see below)
    - `SEM_results*.csv` and `lavaan_results.csv` contain the actual results of fitting the SEM model using `OpenMX` and `lavaan`, respectively, and are described in the corresponding `*_explanations.md` `Markdown` documents

  - `final` contains the final results of the analysis, encapsulated in the comma-separated CSV file `heritability_results.csv` and described in the `heritability_results.md` `Markdown` document

- `figures` contains various figures (autmatically or manually generated) used in the paper and the supplemenary information

- `code` contains the various files needed to perform the analysis and draw the plots:

  - there are 4 pre-processing scripts that need to be run in sequence (but only when the "real" `measures.csv` file is available!):
  
    - `1_data_preparation.R`: `R`script for data cleaning and preparation for downstream analysis
    - `2_OpenMx_model.R` and `2_lavaan_model.R`: `R` scripts that fit the Genetic Covariance Structure Model (GCSM) to the data using either `OpenMX` or `lavaan`
    - `3_analysis.Rmd`: the `Rmarkdown`  script that puts everything together and peforms the actual analyses and plots; it generates the next file:
    - `full_analysis_report.html`: the Full Analysis Report, a self-contained `HTML` document that encapsulates all the analyses and plots.
    - three figures used to genrate the full analysis report
